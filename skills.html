    <h2>Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)</h2>
    <p>Course Description - This course aims to teach everyone the basics of programming computers using Python. We cover the basics of how one constructs a program from a series of simple instructions in Python.  The course has no pre-requisites and avoids all but the simplest mathematics. Anyone with moderate computer experience should be able to master the materials in this course. This course will cover Chapters 1-5 of the textbook “Python for Everybody”.  Once a student completes this course, they will be ready to take more advanced programming courses. This course covers Python 3.</p>

    <h2>Python Data Structures</h2>
    <p>Course Description - This course will introduce the core data structures of the Python programming language. We will move past the basics of procedural programming and explore how we can use the Python built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples to perform increasingly complex data analysis. This course will cover Chapters 6-10 of the textbook “Python for Everybody”.  This course covers Python 3.</p>

    <h2>JavaScript and AJAX: Integration Techniques</h2>
    <p>Course Description - The ability to read data and communicate information asynchronously is fundamental to modern web applications. In this course, author Ray Villalobos takes a look at integrating AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) with JavaScript and jQuery—a combination that makes it easy to work with dynamic data and reduces the number of requests to the server. The course first explains what AJAX is, and shows how to load and reload pages with pure JavaScript, update the DOM, and read and parse data in the XML and JSON formats. Next, learn how to read and write information between the server and the client with AJAX methods in jQuery, and build a dynamic search application that updates search results as you type.</p>

    <h2>JavaScript and JSON: Integration Techniques</h2>
    <p>Course Description - JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) has replaced XML as the core way of sharing data, especially when it comes to JavaScript, since it's so much faster, sleeker, and easier to parse. In this course, dive into working with JSON tools, designing JSON objects, and using different ways to handling JSON data. Author Ray Villalobos also shows how to use AJAX and jQuery to parse your data and feeds, and shows JavaScript and JSON in action in a real-world practical application.</p>

    <h2>HTML Essential Training</h2>
    <p>Course Description - HTML is the programming language that powers the web. And like any language, once you master it, you can begin to create your own content, whether that's simple websites or complex web applications. This course provides an in-depth look at the essentials: the syntax of HTML and best practices for writing and editing your code. Senior staff author James Williamson reviews the structure of a typical HTML document, and shows how to section pages and format your content with HTML. Plus, learn how to create links and lists, and find out how HTML works with CSS and JavaScript to create rich, engaging user experiences. So open a text editor, watch these videos, and begin learning to author HTML the right way.</p>

    <h2>HTTP Essential Training</h2>
    <p>Course Description - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is one of the most utilized protocols on the internet. In this course, instructor Morten Rand-Hendriksen helps you bolster your understanding of how HTTP works by reviewing fundamental concepts. He begins by explaining what HTTP is, and then covers key terminology and the HTTP flow. He then discusses the request/response pair, HTTP methods, and status messages. To wrap up, he goes over HTTP headers, explaining what they are and how to see them.</p>

    <h2>Learning CSS</h2>
    <p>Course Description - CSS is a stylesheet language that allows you to control the appearance of your webpages. In this hands-on course—the first installment in an ongoing series—Christina Truong demonstrates the concepts that form the foundation of CSS, and explains how to use this language to add colors and other design elements to take your webpages beyond just black text on a white background. Christina covers selecting content, how the box model defines the spacing and sizing of page elements, styling text, and managing basic layouts. She also explores the tools needed to work with CSS, how to use selectors to target elements, and guidelines for page layouts with floats. Plus, at the end of the course, you'll walk away with an actual project—an online résumé page.</p>
